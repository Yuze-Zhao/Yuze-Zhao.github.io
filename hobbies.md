This page is about my hobbies beyond math. Over the past years, Iâ€™ve stayed passionate about traveling, cuisine, volleyball and anime ever since my junior days. Both have given me strength, joy, and the drive to chase after what I truly want. If youâ€™re also into same hobbies, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to chat and share more!

# Volleyball

<br>Volleyball is such a wonderful sport! My advisor likes to say that playing volleyball is a lot like doing researchâ€”you need solid fundamentals, good technique, teamwork, strategy, and plenty of perseverance. For me, volleyball has not only kept me active but also helped me make friends and share great moments together.

<br>I spent four years in Dalian for my undergrad, and it pretty much became my second home. In those years, I explored a lot, tasted amazing food, and the three photos above are my favorite picks. 

<br>BTW, the [cable car line] worth trying!
